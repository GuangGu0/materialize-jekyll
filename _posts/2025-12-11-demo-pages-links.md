Created two standalone HTML pages for testing navigation and layout:

- [Demo One]({{ site.baseurl }}/demo-one/)
- [Demo Two]({{ site.baseurl }}/demo-two/)

Both pages reuse the `page` layout, so they keep the global header/footer and styling. Feel free to replace the content with real pages later.
